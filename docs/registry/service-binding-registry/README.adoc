= Binding OpenShift applications to {product-long-kafka} and {product-long-registry}
:context: service-binding

[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can connect applications on a Kubernetes platform such as Red Hat OpenShift to cloud services such as {product-long-kafka} and {product-long-registry}.

For example, suppose you have the following applications deployed on OpenShift:

* One application that publishes price updates for a variety of stocks
* A second application that consumes the price updates for publication on a web page

In addition, suppose you have a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}. Each time the first application produces a price update, you want to use the Kafka instance to forward the update as an event to the second, consuming application.
To achieve this behavior, you need a way to connect the applications on OpenShift to your Kafka instance in {product-kafka}.

In cases such as this, you can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator. The Service Binding Operator automatically provides an application on Kubernetes with the parameters required to connect to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}. This process is called __service binding__.

You can also use the Service Binding Operator to connect the application to a {registry} instance. {registry} instances store value and key schemas (as well as APIs). When you use a schema with your Kafka instance, the schema ensures that messages conform to a specified format.

This guide describes how to perform service binding for {product-kafka} and {registry}. The Kubernetes platform referred to in the remainder of this guide is Red Hat OpenShift.


[id="con-about-service-binding_{context}"]
== About service binding

You can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator to automatically provide an application on OpenShift with the parameters required to connect to a specified Kafka instance in {product-kafka}. If you're using a schema with your Kafka instance, you can also use the Service Binding Operator to provide the application with connection parameters for a {registry} instance. Using the Service Binding Operator to automatically generate connection parameters for these cloud services is called __service binding__.

To perform service binding, you must also install the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) Operator.
The RHOAS Operator exposes a Kafka or {registry} instance to an OpenShift cluster. The Service Binding Operator then collects and shares the information required for an application running on the OpenShift cluster to connect to the Kafka or {registry} instance.

When the RHOAS Operator and Service Binding Operator are installed, you can use the RHOAS CLI or OpenShift web console to perform service binding. When connection between your application and Kafka or {registry} instance is established, you can then work directly with the instance using standard OpenShift features and APIs.

As part of the service binding process, the Service Binding Operator injects connection parameters for the Kafka or {registry} instance into the pod for your application, as files.

When you bind to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}, the Service Binding Operator creates the following directory and file structure in the application pod:

.Files injected by the Service Binding Operator for a Kakfa instance
[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
/bindings/__<kafka-instance-name>__
├── bootstrapServers
├── password
├── provider
├── saslMechanism
├── securityProtocol
├── type
└── user
----

Each file that the Service Binding Operator injects into the application pod contains a single connection parameter, specified in plain text. The connection parameters that correspond to the injected files are described below.

bootstrapServers:: Bootstrap server endpoint for the Kafka instance.
password:: Password for connection to the Kafka instance.
provider:: Cloud provider for the Kafka instance.
saslMechanism:: Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism used by the Kafka instance for client authentication.
securityProtocol:: Protocol used by the Kafka instance to secure client connections.
type:: Metadata that identifies the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) service. For a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}, this is set to a value of `kafka`.
user:: User name for connection to the Kafka instance.

When you bind to a {registry} instance, the Service Binding Operator creates the following directory and file structure in the application pod:

.Files injected by the Service Binding Operator for a {registry} instance
[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
/bindings/__<registry-instance-name>__
├── clientId
├── clientSecret
├── oauthRealm
├── oauthTokenUrl
├── registry
└── type
----

Each file that the Service Binding Operator injects into the application pod contains a single connection parameter, specified in plain text. The connection parameters that correspond to the injected files are described below. Some of these parameters are required by the OAuth (Open Authorization) protocol, which is used to secure connections to {registry} instances.

clientId:: Client ID used by OAuth to connect to the {registry} instance.
clientSecret:: Name of the secret that contains the password used by OAuth to connect to the {registry} instance.
oauthRealm:: Authentication realm used by OAuth to connect to the {registry} instance.
oauthTokenUrl:: Endpoint for the access token used by OAuth to connect to the {registry} instance.
registry:: Endpoint for the {registry} instance.
type:: Metadata that identifies the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) service. For a {registry} instance, this is set to a value of `service-registry`.

== Connecting a Kafka and {registry} instance to your OpenShift cluster

[role="_abstract"]
When you've verified connection to your OpenShift cluster, you can connect Kafka and {registry} instances to the current project in the cluster. You must establish these connections before you can bind applications running in the project to the Kafka and {registry} instances.

The following procedure shows how to use the RHOAS CLI to connect a specified Kafka or {registry} instance to a project in your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can bind an application running on OpenShift to your Kafka and {registry} instances, you must connect *each* of these cloud services to your OpenShift cluster. Therefore, you must perform the following procedure for both services.
====

.Prerequisites
* You've installed the RHOAS Operator and verified connection to your OpenShift cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster].
* You’ve created a Kafka instance in {product-kafka} and the instance is in the *Ready* state. To learn how to create a Kafka instance, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-kafka}[Getting started with {product-long-kafka}^].
* You've created a {registry} instance, and it's in the *Ready* state. To learn how to create a {registry} instance, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-registry}[Getting started with {product-long-registry}^].
* You have an API token to connect to your cloud services instances. To get a token, see the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token^] page.
* You understand how Access Control Lists (ACLs) enable you to manage how user accounts and service accounts can access the Kafka resources that you create. For more information, see {base-url}{access-mgmt-url-kafka}[Managing account access in {product-long-kafka}^].
* You understand how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables you to manage how user accounts and service accounts can access the {registry} instances you create and the artifacts they contain. For more information, see {base-url}{access-mgmt-url-registry}[Managing account access in {product-long-registry}^].

.Procedure

. If you're not already logged in to the OpenShift CLI, log in using a token, as described in {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster].

. Log in to the RHOAS CLI.

+
Based on the service you select, you're prompted to specify the Kafka or {registry} instance that you want to connect to OpenShift.

.  If you have more than one Kafka or {registry} instance, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the instance that you want to connect to OpenShift. Press *Enter*.
+
The RHOAS CLI shows details for the connection that you'll create. The following example shows connection details for a Kafka instance.
+
.Example connection details

Service Name: my-kafka-instance
Kubernetes Namespace:  my-project
Service Account Secret: rh-cloud-services-service-account
----

. Verify the connection details shown by the RHOAS CLI. When you're ready to continue, type `y` and then press *Enter*.
+
You're prompted to provide an access token. The RHOAS Operator requires this token to connect to your Kafka or {registry} instance.

. In your web browser, open the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token^] page.

. On the OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token page, click **Load token**. When the page is refreshed, copy the API token shown.

. On the command line, right-click and select *Paste*. Press *Enter*.
+
Based on the cloud service that you previously selected, the RHOAS Operator uses the API token to create a `KafkaConnection` or `ServiceRegistryConnection` object on your OpenShift cluster.
+
The following example shows output for a Kafka instance.
+
.Example output from rhoas cluster connect command

----
+
As shown in the preceding example, the RHOAS Operator creates a new service account to access the Kafka or {registry} instance that you specified. The Operator stores the service account information in a secret.
+
The RHOAS Operator also creates a `KafkaConnection` or `ServiceRegistryConnection` object for your Kafka or {registry} instance, which connects the instance to the OpenShift cluster. When you bind your Kafka or {registry} instance to an application on OpenShift, the Service Binding Operator uses the `KafkaConnection` or `ServiceRegistryConnection` object to provide the application with the necessary connection information for the instance. Binding an application to your Kafka or {registry} instance is described later in this guide.

. Enable the new service account created by the RHOAS Operator to access the Kafka or {registry} instance that you specified.

== Binding a Quarkus application to {product-long-kafka} and {product-long-registry} using the RHOAS CLI

When the RHOAS Operator and Service Binding Operator are installed on your OpenShift cluster and you've connected a Kafka and {registry} instance to the cluster, you're ready to deploy an application and perform service binding. __Service binding__ means instructing the Service Binding Operator to automatically inject the application with the parameters required to connect to the Kafka and {registry} instances.

The following tutorial shows how to use the RHOAS CLI to perform service binding. In the tutorial, you create an example Quarkus application and connect this to a Kafka and {registry} instance. link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes-native Java framework that is optimized for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments. The Quarkus application in the tutorial uses an Apache Avro schema to serialize and deserialize messages. The application automatically publishes the Avro schema that it uses to your {registry} instance.

When you perform service binding, the Service Binding Operator automatically injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application. The Quarkus application uses link:https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding[service binding extensions^] for Kafka, {registry}, and the Service Binding Operator. These extensions enable the application to automatically detect and use the injected connection parameters, eliminating the need for manual configuration of the application.

In general, this automatic injection and detection of connection parameters eliminates the need to manually configure an application to connect to a Kafka or {registry} instance. This is a particular advantage if you have many applications in your project that you want to connect to these cloud services.

=== Prerequisites
* The Service Binding Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-installing-service-binding-operator_{context}[Installing the Service Binding Operator on OpenShift].
* The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster and you've verified connection to the cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster].
* You've connected a Kafka and {registry} instance to a project in your OpenShift cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-connecting-kafka-registry-instance-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Connecting a Kafka and {registry} instance to your OpenShift cluster].

[id="proc-kafka-registry-deploying-example-quarkus-application-on-openshift_{context}"]
=== Deploying an example Quarkus application on OpenShift

[role="_abstract"]
In this step of the tutorial, you deploy an example Quarkus application in the OpenShift project that you previously connected your Kafka and {registry} instances to.

The Quarkus application generates random movie names and produces those names to a Kafka topic. Another part of the application consumes the names from the Kafka topic. Finally, the application uses __server-sent events__ to expose the numbers as a REST UI. A web page in the application displays the exposed names.

The example Quarkus application uses link:https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding[service binding extensions^] for Kafka, {registry}, and the Service Binding Operator. These extensions enable the application to automatically detect and use the injected connection parameters, eliminating the need for manual configuration of the application.

.Prerequisites
* You have privileges to deploy applications in the OpenShift project that you connected your Kafka and {registry} instances to.

.Procedure

. If you're not already logged in to the OpenShift CLI, log in using a token, as described in {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster]. Log in as the same user who verified connection to the cluster.

. Use the OpenShift CLI to ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one that you previously connected your Kafka and {registry} instances to, as shown in the following example.
+
.Using the OpenShift CLI to specify the current OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ oc project my-project
----

. To create the Quarkus application, deploy a container image provided by {org-name}.
+
.Deploying an example Quarkus application

deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "kafka-avro-schema-quickstart" created
service "kafka-avro-schema-quickstart" created
----
+
As shown in the output, when you deploy the application, OpenShift creates a service for the application. However, the service is *not* exposed by default. You must expose the service to create a route for clients to access the application.

. Expose the previously created service to create a route to the application.
+
.Creating a route to the Quarkus application
[source,options="nowrap"]

----

. On the command line, highlight the URL shown under *HOST/PORT*. Right-click and select *Copy*.

. In your web browser, paste the URL for the route. Ensure that the URL includes `http://`.
+
A web page for the Quarkus application opens.

. In your web browser, append `/movies.html` to the URL.
+
A new web page entitled *Last movie* opens.  Because you haven't yet connected the Quarkus application to your Kafka instance, the name value appears as `N/A`.

In the previous step of this tutorial, you deployed an example application on OpenShift. The application is a Quarkus application that uses a Kafka topic called `movies` to produce and consume messages. In this step, you create the `movies` topic in your Kafka instance.

.Prerequisites
* You've deployed the example Quarkus application. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-kafka-registry-deploying-example-quarkus-application-on-openshift_{context}[Deploying an example Quarkus application on OpenShift].
* You’ve created a Kafka instance in {product-kafka} and the instance is in the *Ready* state. To learn how to create a Kafka instance, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-kafka}[Getting started with {product-long-kafka}^].

.Procedure
. On the link:{service-url}[Kafka Instances^] page of the {product-kafka} web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.

. Select the *Topics* tab, click *Create topic*, and follow the guided steps to define the details of the `movies` topic. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.

*Topic name*:: Enter `movies` as the topic name.
*Partitions*:: Set the number of partitions for this topic. For this tutorial, set a value of `1`. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
+
NOTE: You can increase the number of partitions later, but you cannot decrease them.
+
*Message retention*:: Set the message retention time to the relevant value and increment. For this tutorial, set a value of `A week`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy.
*Replicas*:: For this release of {product-kafka}, the replicas are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.
+
After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table.

=== Binding the Quarkus application to your Kafka and {registry} instances using the RHOAS CLI

[role="_abstract"]
In this step of the tutorial, you use the RHOAS CLI to bind the example Quarkus application that you deployed on OpenShift to your Kafka and {registry} instances. When you perform this binding, the Service Binding Operator injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application. The Quarkus application automatically detects and uses the connection parameters to bind to the Kafka and {registry} instances.

.Prerequisites
* The Service Binding Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-installing-service-binding-operator_{context}[Installing the Service Binding Operator on OpenShift].
* You understand how the Service Binding Operator injects connection parameters as files into the pod for a client application. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#con-about-service-binding_{context}[About service binding].
* The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster and you've verified connection to the cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster].
* You've connected both a Kafka and {registry} instance to a project in your OpenShift cluster. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-connecting-kafka-registry-instance-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Connecting a Kafka and {registry} instance to your OpenShift cluster].
* You've deployed the example Quarkus application. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-kafka-registry-deploying-example-quarkus-application-on-openshift_{context}[Deploying an example Quarkus application on OpenShift].
* You've created the topic required by the Quarkus application. See {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-creating-movies-topic-in-kafka-instance_{context}[Creating the movies topic in your Kafka instance].

.Procedure
. If you're not already logged in to the OpenShift CLI, log in using a token, as described in {base-url}{service-binding-url-registry}#proc-verifying-connection-to-openshift-cluster_{context}[Verifying connection to your OpenShift cluster]. Log in as the same user who verified connection to the cluster.

. Log in to the RHOAS CLI.

----
$ rhoas cluster bind

+
You're prompted to specify the cloud service that you want to bind to your OpenShift application.
+
IMPORTANT: Steps 5-8 that follow show how to bind a *Kafka* instance to the Quarkus application. Later in the procedure, you're instructed to repeat the steps for your *{registry}* instance.

. Use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight `kafka`. Press *Enter*.
+
You're prompted to specify the Kafka instance that you want to bind to an application in your OpenShift project.

.  If you have more than one Kafka instance, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the instance that you want to bind to an application in OpenShift. Press *Enter*.
+
You're prompted to specify the application that you want to bind your Kafka instance to.

. If you have more than one application in your OpenShift project, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the `kafka-avro-schema-quickstart` example application. Press *Enter*.

. Type `y` to confirm that you want to continue. Press *Enter*.
+
When binding is complete, you should see output like the following:
+
.Example output from binding a Kafka instance to an application in OpenShift
[source]
----
Using Service Binding Operator to perform binding
Binding my-kafka-instance with kafka-avro-schema-quickstart app succeeded
----
+
The output shows that the RHOAS CLI successfully instructed the Service Binding Operator to bind a Kafka instance called `my-kafka-instance` to the example Quarkus application called `kafka-avro-schema-quickstart`. The Quarkus application automatically detected the connection parameters injected by the Service Binding Operator and used them to bind with the Kafka instance.

. *Repeat steps 5-8* of this procedure to bind your {registry} instance to the Quarkus application. This time, when you're prompted to specify the cloud service that you want to connect to OpenShift, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight `service-registry`.
+
When service binding is complete, OpenShift redeploys the Quarkus application. When the application is running again, it starts to use the `movies` topic that you created in your Kafka instance. One part of the Quarkus application publishes movie name updates to this topic, while another part of the application consumes the updates.

. To verify that the Quarkus application is using the Kafka topic, reopen the *Last movie* web page that you opened earlier in this tutorial.
+
On the *Last movie* web page, observe that the movie name is continuously updated. The updates show that the Quarkus application is now using the `movies` topic in your Kafka instance to produce and consume messages.
