= Managing account access in {product-long-kafka}
ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]
:context: managing-access

// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As an owner of a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}, you can manage the level of access that other user accounts and service accounts have to your instance. You can allow or deny access to your instance for specific accounts or for all accounts in your organization. You can also allow other users or service accounts to manage the level of access to your instance for you.

You can manage access for only the Kafka instances that you create or for instances that the owner has enabled you to access and alter.

//Additional line break to resolve mod docs generation error, not sure why. Leaving for now. (Stetson, 20 May 2021)

[id="con-access-management_{context}"]
== Access management in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
{product-kafka} uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) provided by Kafka that enable you to manage how other user accounts and service accounts are permitted to access the Kafka resources that you create. You can manage access for only the Kafka instances that you create or for instances that the owner has enabled you to access and alter.

An account in {product-kafka} is either a user account or a service account. A user account enables users in your organization to access your resources. A service account enables your application or tool to connect securely to your instance and access your resources.

A resource in an ACL can be a Kafka instance, topic, consumer group, or producer transaction. You use the ACL to define how specific accounts or all accounts in an organization are permitted to access these resources.

An ACL permission setting typically consists of the following components:

* A single named account or all accounts within the organization that you want to manage access for
* A single named resource, all resources of a particular type (such as a topic, consumer group, or transactional ID), or all resources of a particular type with a specified prefix
* A single operation (such as `Write`) or all operations for the specified resource or resources

You can also allow other users or service accounts to manage access to the resources in your instance for you.

If two or more permission settings in an ACL match a request being made to the Kafka broker and at least one of the matching permissions specifies that the action is denied, then the request is denied.

=== Supported ACL permissions in {product-kafka}

An ACL acts as a mapping of permitted operations on specified resources for a selected account or for all accounts in an organization. An account can be either a user account or a service account. Operations correspond to Kafka APIs or request types that relate to the specified resource.

For example, a `Read` operation for a `Topic` resource corresponds to the `Fetch`, `OffsetCommit`, and `TxnOffsetCommit` Kafka requests. A `Write` operation for a `Topic` resource corresponds to the `Produce` and `AddPartitionsToTxn` Kafka requests.

The following table lists the supported ACL permissions in {product-kafka}.

NOTE: The resource identifier `Is` supports the wildcard character `*` to denote any occurrences of the specified resource. For example, `Topic is *` means any topic in a Kafka instance.

[id="proc-setting-permissions_{context}"]
== Setting account permissions in a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-kafka}, you can create Access Control Lists (ACLs) in your Kafka instances and set permissions for how other user accounts or service accounts can interact with an instance and its resources. You can manage access for only the Kafka instances that you create or for the instances that the owner has enabled you to access and alter.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.
* The user account or service account that you're setting permissions for has been created in the organization.

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to set permissions for.
. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL permissions for this instance.
. Use this *Access* page to set permissions for a new account, add permissions to an existing account, or delete account permissions in this instance.
+
* To set permissions for a new account in this instance, follow these steps:

.. Click *Manage access*.
.. In the *Account* drop-down menu, select the new user account or service account that you want to set permissions for. You can also select *All accounts* to set permissions for all user accounts and service accounts in the organization.
+
If you don't see users in the drop-down list, ask your organization administrator to grant access to view other user accounts. For more information, see {base-url}{access-mgmt-url-kafka}#proc-user-account-access_managing-access[Allowing users to view other user accounts].
.. Click *Next*.
+
--
The *Review existing permissions* section lists any permission settings in this instance that are already defined for all accounts in the organization and for the same account that you previously selected, if applicable. You can delete existing permissions now if needed, or you can wait to delete existing permissions later from the main *Access* page.

If you previously selected a specific account, you can delete only permission entries that apply to individual accounts. If you previously selected *All accounts*, you can delete only permission entries that apply to all accounts.
--
.. Under *Assign Permissions*, use the drop-down menu to select and define the permissions for the specified account or all accounts for a resource type, such as a topic.
+
--
The following permission options are available:

** *Add permission*: Empty permission entry that you must define manually
** *Consume from a topic*: Predefined permission entry for consuming from one or more specified topics
** *Produce to a topic*: Predefined permission entry for producing to one or more specified topics
** *Manage access*: Predefined permission entry for allowing other user accounts or service accounts to access and alter the permissions in the Kafka instance

For example, when you create a new service account, select the *Consume from a topic* and *Produce to a topic* predefined options and set all resource identifiers and values to `Is *`. These permissions enable applications associated with the service account to create and delete topics in the Kafka instance, to produce and consume messages in any topic in the instance, and to use any consumer group and any producer.

These permission settings result in the following ACL permissions for the new service account:

.Example ACL permissions for a new service account
[cols="25%,25%,25%,25%"]
|===
h|Resource type
h|Resource identifier and value
h|Access type
h|Operation

|`Topic`

(For consuming)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Read`, `Describe`

|`Consumer group`

(For consuming)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Read`

|`Topic`

(For producing)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Write`, `Create`, `Describe`
|===

NOTE: Alternatively, you can click *Add permission* to individually create one `Topic` entry and one `Consumer group` entry, both with `Allow` access to `All` operations. This enables both consuming and producing for the topic in a single entry, and enables all permissions for the consumer group in a single entry. But you must configure these entries individually without using the predefined permission options.

--
.. Click *Save* to finish.

* To add permissions to an existing account in this instance, follow these steps:

.. For the account that you want to add permissions to, select the options icon (three vertical dots) for that entry and click *Manage*.
+
--
The *Review existing permissions* section lists any permission settings in this instance that are already defined for all accounts in the organization and for the same account that you previously selected, if applicable. You can delete existing permissions now if needed, or you can wait to delete existing permissions later from the main *Access* page.

If you selected a permission entry that applies to a specific account, you can delete only permission entries that apply to individual accounts. If you selected a permission entry that applies to all accounts, you can delete only permission entries that apply to all accounts.
--
.. Under *Assign Permissions*, use the drop-down menu to select and define the permissions for the specified account or all accounts for a resource type, such as a topic. You can click *Add permission* to add permissions individually, or you can select from the predefined permission options as described previously.
.. Click *Save* to finish.

* To delete existing account permissions in this instance, use the following options:

 ** Select one or more permission entries, select the options icon (three vertical dots) at the top of the table, and click *Delete selected permissions*.
 ** For the account that you want to delete, select the options icon (three vertical dots) for that entry and click *Delete*.

+
IMPORTANT: If you delete a user account or service account, you should also delete any ACL permissions associated with that account. If you don't delete unused ACL permissions, then a future account with the same ID of a previously deleted account could inherit the ACL permissions and have automatic access to a Kafka instance.

== Example account access scenarios in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
The following example Access Control Lists (ACLs) illustrate common scenarios for managing the level of access for user accounts or service accounts in {product-kafka}. Some examples differ from the predefined permissions in {product-kafka} to demonstrate various possible ACL scenarios. Use these examples as a guide for your own ACLs.

[id="proc-user-account-access_{context}"]
== Allowing users to view other user accounts

[role="_abstract"]
As an organization administrator, you can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to allow users to view other users in an organization.

You set up access by assigning a predefined role called `User Access principal viewer` to a user group.
By assigning the role, users within the group are able to do the following:

* View and select other users when changing owners and managing access to Kafka instances in the web console
* Specify user names when using the `rhoas` CLI for {product-long-kafka}

.Prerequisites
* You're logged into the {org-name} web console as an organization administrator.
* A user group contains the users to assign the role to.

NOTE: If you want to add the `User Access principal viewer` role to a single user, create a new group for that user only.

ifndef::community[]
For more information on setting up user access in the web console, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/[_User Access Configuration Guide for Role-based Access Control (RBAC)_^].
endif::[]

.Procedure

. In the upper-right corner of the {product-kafka} web console, select the gear icon, and click *Settings* > *User Access* > *Groups*
. Click the name of the user group.
. From the *Roles* tab, click *Add role* and select `User Access principal viewer` to add the role to the group.
. Click *Add to group* to add the role to the group.
+
The role is added to the list of selected roles on the *Roles* tab.
