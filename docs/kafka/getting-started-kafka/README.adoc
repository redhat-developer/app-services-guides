// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use {product-long-kafka} to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. {product-kafka} is a managed cloud service that enables you to add Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

//For more overview information about {product-kafka}, see [variablized link to overview here https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/].


ifndef::community[]
.Prerequisites
* You have a Red Hat account.
//* You have a subscription to {product-long-kafka}. For more information about signing up, see *<@SME: Where to link?>*.
endif::[]

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

[id="proc-creating-kafka-instance_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-kafka} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services. A Kafka instance in {product-kafka} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configurations needed for producers and consumers to connect to the instance.

ifndef::qs[]
.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-kafka} web console at {service-url-kafka}[^].
* You're familiar with the different Kafka instance sizes that you can create in {product-kafka}, and the capacities that correspond to those sizes. For more information about the capacities and service limits of your Kafka instance, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka Service Limits].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {product-kafka} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click *Create Kafka instance*.
. Enter a unique name for the Kafka instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
. From the *Cloud region* drop-down menu, select the relevant option. The selection for availability zones is preconfigured as *Single* for a trial instance and *Multi* for a production instance.
+
NOTE: The cloud provider is preconfigured.
+
////
//For post preview, when more options are available.
. In the *Streams for Apache Kafka* page of the web console, click *Create Kafka instance* and define the following instance details. Some values currently have only one option.
* *Instance name*: Enter a unique name for the instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
* *Cloud provider*: Select `Amazon Web Services`.
* *Cloud region*: Select `US East, N. Virginia`.
* *Availability zones*: Select `Multi`.
////
. If you've purchased a subscription for {product-kafka}, use the slider to select an instance size. Instances with more streaming units have more capacity.
+
NOTE: In {product-kafka}, you can create Kafka instances of 1 or 2 streaming units. Instances larger than 1 streaming unit are currently available only as a Technology Preview and should not be used in production. If you're creating a trial instance, the instance size is preconfigured.


. Click *Create instance* to start the creation process for your Kafka instance.

// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

[id="proc-creating-service-account_{context}"]
== Creating a service account to connect to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in the {product-kafka} web console, you need to create a service account that's associated with the instance. You also need to save the bootstrap server endpoint for the instance, the generated service account credentials, and the authentication token endpoint to a secure location. You'll use the service account and Kafka instance information later when you configure your application.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, for the relevant Kafka instance that you want to connect to, select the options icon (three vertical dots) and click *Connection*.
. In the *Connection* page, copy the *Bootstrap server* endpoint to a secure location. This is the bootstrap server endpoint that you'll need for connecting to this Kafka instance.
+
ifdef::qs[]
The remainder of this task describes how to create a service account and copy the generated credentials.
If you want to use the credentials of an _existing_ service account, you can skip to the next task.
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
The remainder of this section describes how to create a service account and copy the generated credentials.
If you want to use the credentials of an _existing_ service account, you can skip to the next section.
endif::[]
. Click *Create service account* to set up the account that you'll use to access this Kafka instance.
. Enter a short description, such as `my-service-account`, and click *Create*.
. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client secret* values to a secure location. These are the credentials that you'll use to connect to this Kafka instance.
+
IMPORTANT: The generated credentials are displayed only one time, so ensure that you've successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window.

. After you save the generated credentials to a secure location, select the confirmation check box in the credentials window and close the window.
. For the *Authentication method*, copy the SASL/OAUTHBEARER *Token endpoint URL* to a secure location. This is the endpoint that you'll use with your service account credentials to authenticate the connection to this Kafka instance.
+
NOTE: SASL/PLAIN authentication is also available for tools and libraries that don't support SASL/OAUTHBEARER, but SASL/OAUTHBEARER is recommended whenever possible. With SASL/PLAIN authentication, you use only the service account credentials to authenticate the connection to the Kafka instance.

+
You'll use the service account information that you saved to configure your application to connect to your Kafka instances when you're ready.
. To review your service account information, reset your credentials, or delete the service account, use the left navigation menu to go to the *Service Accounts* page.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you save the bootstrap server, client credentials, and authentication token endpoint to a secure location?
* Did you verify that your service account was successfully created in the *Service Accounts* page?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the bootstrap server, client credentials, and authentication token endpoint are saved to a secure location.
. Verify that your service account was successfully created in the *Service Accounts* page.
endif::[]

[id="proc-setting-service-account-permissions_{context}"]
== Setting permissions for a service account in a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a service account to connect to a Kafka instance, you must also set the appropriate level of access for that new account in the Access Control List (ACL) of the Kafka instance. {product-kafka} uses ACLs provided by Kafka that enable you to manage how other user accounts and service accounts are permitted to interact with the Kafka resources that you create.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.
* You've created a service account that you want to allow to access the running Kafka instance.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want the service account to access.
. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL for this instance.
. Click *Manage access*, use the *Account* drop-down menu to select the service account that you previously created, and click *Next*.
. Under *Assign Permissions*, use the drop-down menu to select the *Consume from a topic* and the *Produce to a topic* permission options, and set all resource identifiers to `Is` and all identifier values to `*`.
+
--
These permissions enable applications associated with the service account to create and delete topics in the Kafka instance, to produce and consume messages in any topic in the instance, and to use any consumer group and any producer.

These permission settings result in the following ACL permissions for the new service account:

.Example ACL permissions for a new service account
[cols="25%,25%,25%,25%"]
|===
h|Resource type
h|Resource identifier and value
h|Access type
h|Operation

|`Topic`

(For consuming)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Read`, `Describe`

|`Consumer group`

(For consuming)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Read`

|`Topic`

(For producing)
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Write`, `Create`, `Describe`
|===

NOTE: Alternatively, you can click *Add permission* to create individual permissions as needed. For example, you can create one `Topic` entry and one `Consumer group` entry, both with `Allow` access to `All` operations. This enables both consuming and producing for the specified topic in a single entry, and enables all permissions for the consumer group in another single entry. But you must configure these entries individually without using the predefined permission options.

--
. After you add these permissions for the service account, click *Save* to finish.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Are the new permissions for the service account listed in the *Access* page of the Kafka instance?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the new permissions for the service account are listed in the *Access* page of the Kafka instance.

[id="proc-creating-kafka-topic_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka topic in {product-kafka}

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Select the *Topics* tab, click *Create topic*, and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.
+
--
[.screencapture]
.Guided steps to define topic details
image::sak-create-topic.png[Image of wizard to create a topic]

* *Topic name*: Enter a unique topic name, such as `my-first-kafka-topic`.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partition to `1` for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time and size to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention time to `A week` and the retention size to `Unlimited`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy. Retention size is the maximum total size of all log segments in a partition before they are deleted or compacted.
* *Replicas*: Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. For this release of {product-kafka}, the replicas are preconfigured. For a standard Kafka instance, the number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. For a trial Kafka instance, the number of replicas and the minimum in-sync replica factor are both set to a fixed value of `1`.  Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.

After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table. You can now start producing and consuming messages to and from this topic using services that you connect to this instance.

ifndef::community[]
NOTE: If you try to create a topic with a number of partitions that would cause the partition limit of the Kafka instance to be exceeded, you see an error message indicating this. For more information about partition limits for Kafka instances, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[{product-long-kafka} service limits].
endif::[]

NOTE: If the topic creation is unsuccessful and you see a `400 Bad Request` error message, try to create your topic again later. This situation might occur, for example, if your selected cloud provider has a temporary availability problem that affects your Kafka instance.

--
. In the topics table, on the right side of the Kafka topic, use the options icon (three vertical dots) to edit or delete the topic as needed.
