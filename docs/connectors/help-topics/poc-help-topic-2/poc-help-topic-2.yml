    **POC help topic for Connectors context-sensitive help drawer**

    An Access Control List is a list of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a Connector. Each type of Connector requires specifc ACLs.You define ACLs in the Kafka instance. You can specify the same ACLs for all topics in the Kafka instance or for a specific topic.
    You associate a Connector to a Kafka instance with a service account (client ID and secret). Use service accounts to connect and authenticate your Connector instances with topics in a Kafka instance.
