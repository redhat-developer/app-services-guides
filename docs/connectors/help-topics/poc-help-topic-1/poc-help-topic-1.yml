    You need a Connectors namespace for hosting your Connector instances. 
    To create a Connectors namespace on your OpenShift Dedicated Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) Trial cluster, follow the steps in "Adding the Red Hat OpenShift Connectors add-on to your OpenShift cluster". The trial has a 60-day lifespan and the number of Connectors instances that you create is not limited. The trial environment is useful when you want to create Proof of Concept solutions.
