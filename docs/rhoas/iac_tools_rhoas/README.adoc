= Automating deployment and management of Kafka instances in {product-long-kafka}
ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]
:context: using-iac-tools

[role="_abstract"]
As a system administrator of applications and services, you can use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to automate deployment and management of architectures.

This guide describes how to use different IaC tools to provision and manage Kafka instances in {product-long-kafka}. To interact with Kafka instances, the IaC tools use two REST APIs that are available in {product-kafka} - a _management_ API and an _instance_ API.

ifndef::community[]
For more information about these APIs, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_application_services/1/guide/2409253a-45ee-470e-bdc9-5db4bfcf9d0f.
endif::[]

For more information about creating and setting up Kafka instances, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-kafka}[Getting started with {product-long-kafka}^].

== Ansible

[role="_abstract"]
https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works[Ansible^] is an open source configuration management and automation tool.

Ansible uses _modules_ to execute tasks. The output of one module can be the input for the next one or they can be independent of each other.

You can combine one or more Ansible modules to make a play. Combine two or more plays to create an Ansible playbook, a list of sequential tasks (written in YAML) that automatically executes when you run the `ansible-playbook` command. You can use an Ansible playbook to describe the desired state of your infrastructure and then have Ansible provision it.

An Ansible role is a special kind of playbook that is fully self-contained and portable with the tasks, variables, configuration templates, and other supporting files that are needed to complete your chosen tasks. Multiple roles can exist inside a collection, allowing easy sharing of content through Automation Hub and https://galaxy.ansible.com[Ansible Galaxy^].

[id="proc-install-rhoas-ansible-collection_{context}"]
=== Installing the RHOAS Ansible collection

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the https://galaxy.ansible.com/rhoas/rhoas[RHOAS Ansible collection] to fully manage your Kafka environment with Ansible. You can create, view, configure, and delete the following {product-long-kafka} resources:

* Kafka instances
* Service accounts
* Kafka topics
* Access Control Lists (ACLs)

.Prerequisites

* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.9^] or later is installed.
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001Css5AAC[Ansible 2.9^] or later is installed.
* Some additional dependencies required by this collection are installed. To install these, enter the following commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ pip install rhoas-sdks
$ pip install python-dotenv
----
NOTE: Use the `pip install rhoas-sdks --force reinstall` command to ensure that the most up to date versions of the SDKs are installed.

.Procedure
. Open a new terminal window.
. Create a Python virtual environment.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ python3 -m venv rhoas/
----
. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ . rhoas/bin/activate
----
. Install the {product-long-rhoas} (RHOAS) Ansible collection.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ansible-galaxy collection install rhoas.rhoas
----
+
By default, the `ansible-galaxy collection install` command uses `\https://galaxy.ansible.com` as the Galaxy server URL. The URL is specified as the value of the `GALAXY_SERVER` parameter in the `ansible.cfg` configuration file.
+
A message states that the RHOAS collection was installed successfully to the following path: `home/_<usr>_/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/rhoas/rhoas`. All modules for the collection can be found in this location.
+
When installed, you can reference collection content by the fully qualified collection name (FQCN) of the collection. The command in a task needs to include the FQCN of the module so it always points to the intended collection. For example, the FQCN for the `create_kafka` command is
`rhoas.rhoas.create_kafka`.
+
[NOTE]
====
To find documentation for each module, open a terminal window, enter `ansible-doc rhoas.rhoas._<module_name>_` and replace _<module_name>_ with the name of the module in the terminal. The following example outputs the documentation for the `create_kafka` module. The documentation shows required parameters (denoted by `=`) and optional parameters (denoted by `-`) for the module, as well as examples of how to use the module and the output. If you do not pass in any values for optional fields, Ansible uses the default values from the Kafka APIs.

[source, shell]

[id="proc-using-rhoas-ansible-collection_{context}"]

=== Using the {product-long-rhoas} Ansible collection

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) https://galaxy.ansible.com/rhoas/rhoas[Ansible collection] to fully manage your Kafka environment with Ansible. You can create, view, configure, and delete the following {product-long-kafka} resources:

* Kafka instance
* Service accounts
* Topics
* ACLS

The procedure in this section shows how to create and run an example playbook. The example playbook includes modules for creating a Kafka instance, topic, and service account, and assigning permissions to the service account. You also configure modules to delete the resources that you previously created.

.Prerequisites
* You have a Red Hat account.
* You have an offline token used to authenticate the Ansible modules with the {product-long-rhoas} API.

[NOTE]
The offline token is a refresh token with no expiry and can be used by non-interactive processes to provide an access token for {product-long-rhoas} to authenticate the user. The token is an OpenShift offline token and you can find it at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token.


.Procedure
. In your IDE, create a new enviornment variables (`.env`) file.
. In the `.env` file, add the following variables required by the Ansible collection:
+
`API_BASE_HOST`:: This is the base URL for the API. For example, `\https://api.openshift.com`.
`SSO_BASE_HOST`:: This is the base URL for the Red Hat single sign-on (SSO) service. For example, `\https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external`.
. Save the file in the root directory of the Ansible collection.
+
NOTE: If you do not explicitly define the environment variables, the collection uses the URLs shown in the preceding step.

. Open a terminal window.
. Run a module in the terminal to perform a single task. For example, the following command shows how to run a module that creates a Kafka instance. Replace _<OFFLINE_TOKEN>_ with your OpenShift offline token.
+
.Example create_kafka module
[source,shell]
----
$ ansible localhost -m rhoas.rhoas.create_kafka -a 'name=unique-kafka-name billing_model=standard cloud_provider=aws plan="developer.x1" region="us-east-1" openshift_offline_token=<OFFLINE_TOKEN>'
----

+
Ansible runs the `rhoas.rhoas.create_kafka` task in the terminal and creates the instance.
. To open the example playbook used in later steps, use your IDE to navigate to the `rhoas` folder in the `.ansible` directory.
+
[source]
----
$ cd rhoas
----

. Open the `rhoas_test` example playbook. You can also open a web browser and navigate to https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-ansible/blob/main/rhoas_test.yml to open the `rhoas_test` playbook.
. Inspect the contents of the example playbook. In particular, observe that the playbook has modules for certain tasks. You will use these modules to create a new playbook that performs the following tasks:
+
* Create and delete a Kafka instance
* Create and delete a service account
* Create Access Control List (ACL) permission bindings
* Create, update, and delete a topic
+
[NOTE]
The playbook uses your offline token to authenticate with the Kafka Management API. If you do not specify the token as an argument for a given task, the module attempts to read it from the `OFFLINE_TOKEN` environment variable.
+
[NOTE]
====
The example playbook used in this section includes comments that indicate how to directly specify values rather than fetching them dynamically. For example, to specify a Kafka instance ID, a comment in the playbook states that you can include the following line:

[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
kafka_id: __<kafka_id>__
----
====
+
. In your IDE, create a new playbook file and save it as `rhoas_kafka.yml` in the `rhoas` directory.
. At the start of the new playbook, you define the name of the playbook and the group of hosts on which to run it. Copy the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file. In this example, the host is a local host and the connection is local because you are in a virtual environment.
+
.Example first section for `rhoas_kafka` playbook
[source,yaml]
----
- name: RHOAS kafka
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  connection: local
  tasks:
----

. To add a module that creates a new Kafka instance, copy the `create_kafka` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `tasks:` section of your `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.

+
.Example `create_kafka` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create kafka
    rhoas.rhoas.create_kafka:
      name: "kafka-name"
      instance_type: "x1"
      billing_model: "standard"
      cloud_provider: "aws"
      region: "us-east-1"
      plan: "developer.x1"
      billing_cloud_account_id: "123456789"
      openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
    register:
      kafka_req_resp
----
. In the `name` field, enter a name for the Kafka instance.
. In the `billing_cloud_account_id`, enter the billing cloud account ID.
. In the `openshift_offline_token` field, enter your OpenShift offline token.
+
All other information for the instance is provided by the Kafka APIs.
+
When you run the `create_kafka_` module as part of the playbook at the end of this procedure, Ansible saves the output of that command in a variable in the `register` field. In the preceding example, Ansible saves the created Kafka instance as `kafka_req_resp`.

. To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}, you must first create a service account with credentials. To add a module that creates a service account, copy the `create_service_account` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
+
.Example `create_service_account` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create Service Account
    create_service_account:
      name: "service-account-name"
      description: "This is a description of the service account"
      openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
    register:
      srvce_acc_resp_obj
----
. Enter values for the `name`, `short description`, and `openshift_offline_token` fields.
+
When you run the `create_service_account` module as part of the playbook at the end of this procedure, Ansible populates the generated service account credentials in the `client_id` and `client_secret` fields in the terminal after it creates the service account.
. To create Access Control List (ACL) permissions for the service account and bind that ACL to the Kafka instance, copy the `create_kafka_acl_binding` module shown in the following example and paste it in your `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
+
.Example `create_kafka_acl_binding` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create kafka ACL Service Binding
    rhoas.rhoas.create_kafka_acl_binding:
      kafka_id: "{{ kafka_req_resp.kafka_id }}"
      # To hard code the kafka_id, uncomment and use the following line:
      # kafka_id: "KAFKA_ID"
      principal: " {{ srvce_acc_resp_obj['client_id'] }}"
      # To hard code the principal_id, uncomment and use the following line:
      # principal: "PRINCIPAL_ID"
      resource_name: "topic-name"
      resource_type: "Topic"
      pattern_type: "PREFIXED"
      operation_type: "all"
      permission_type: "allow"
      openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
    register: kafka_acl_resp

----
. You can allow Ansible to get the Kafka ID from the `kafka_req_resp` variable or enter it in the `kafka_id` field.
. In the `openshift_offline_token` field, enter your OpenShift offline token.
+
The following list is a description of each field that must have a value in an ACL binding module.

`principal`:: The user that this binding applies to. This example uses the service account client ID.
`resource_name`:: The name of the resource you want access to. This example uses the name that is passed when creating the topic.
`resource_type`:: The type of resource you want access to. This example uses *Topic*.
`pattern_type`:: The type of pattern of the ACL. This example uses the `PREFIXED` pattern type meaning that Kafka will try to match the prefix of the resource name with the resource specified in the ACL.
`operation_type`:: The type of operation (an action performed on a resource) that is allowed for the given user on this module.
`permission_type`:: Whether permission is given to the user or taken away.

. To create a Kafka topic, copy the contents of the `create_kafka_topic` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
+
.Example `create_kafka_topic` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create Kafka Topic
    create_kafka_topic:
      topic_name: "kafka-topic-name"
      kafka_id: "{{ kafka_req_resp.id }}"
      # To hard code the kafka_id, uncomment and use the following line:
      # kafka_id: "KAFKA_ID"
      partitions: 1
      retention_period_ms: "86400000"
      retention_size_bytes: "1073741824"
      cleanup_policy: "compact"
      openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
    register:
      create_topic_res_obj
----
. You can allow Ansible to get the Kafka ID from the `kafka_req_resp.id` variable or enter it in the `kafka_id` field.
. In the `openshift_offline_token` field, enter your OpenShift offline token.
. To update the configuration of the topic, copy the `update_kafka_topic` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka` file. In the following example, the cleanup policy has been updated from compact to delete by replacing `"compact"` with `"delete"` in the `cleanup_policy` field.
+
.Example `update_kafka_topic` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Update Kafka Topic
    update_kafka_topic:
      topic_name: "kafka-topic-name"
      kafka_id: "{{ kafka_req_resp.id }}"
      # To hard code the kafka_id, uncomment and use the following line:
      # kafka_id: "KAFKA_ID"
      partitions: 1
      retention_period_ms: "86400000"
      retention_size_bytes: "1073741824"
      cleanup_policy: "delete"
      openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
    register:
      update_topic_res_obj
----
. You can allow Ansible to get the Kafka ID from the `kafka_req_resp.id` variable or enter it in the `kafka_id` field.
. (Optional) You can modify the values in the `retention_period_ms` and `retention_size_bytes` fields instead of accepting the default values.
. To delete the topic, copy the `delete_kafka_topic` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
+
.Example `delete_kafka_topic` module
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Delete Kafka Topic
   rhoas.rhoas.delete_kafka_topic:
     topic_name: "KAFKA_TOPIC_NAME"
      kafka_id: "{{ kafka_req_resp_obj['kafka_id'] }}"
      # To hard code the kafka_id, uncomment and use the following line:
      # kafka_id: "KAFKA_ID"
     openshift_offline_token: "OPENSHIFT_OFFLINE_TOKEN"
----
. In the `openshift_offline_token` field, enter your OpenShift offline token.
. You can allow Ansible to get the Kafka ID from the `kafka_req_resp.id` variable or enter it in the `kafka_id` field.
. To delete the service account, copy the `delete_service_account_by_id` module shown in the following example and paste it into the `rhoas_kafka.yml` file.
. Ansible can get the service account ID from the `srvce_acc_resp_obj` variable or you can enter it into the `service_account_id` field.
+
.Example `delete_service_account_by_id` module
[source,yaml]

[id="con-terraform_{context}"]
== Terraform

link:https://www.terraform.io/[HashiCorp Terraform^] is an Infrastructure as Code (Iac) tool that enables you to build and change infrastructure safely and efficiently through human-readable configuration files that you can create versions of, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.

The {product-long-rhoas} (RHOAS) link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/redhat-developer/rhoas/latest[Terraform^] provider is available in the official link:https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform provider registry^] and includes resources to interact with {product-long-rhoas}.

You can fully manage your Kafka environment through your Terraform system using the RHOAS Terraform provider. You can create, view, configure, and delete the following {product-kafka} resources:

* Kafka instances
* Service accounts
* Kafka topics
* Access Control Lists (ACLs)


[id="proc-install-rhoas-terraform-provider_{context}"]
=== Installing the {product-long-rhoas} Terraform provider

.Prerequisites
* You have a Red Hat account.
* https://www.terraform.io/downloads[Terraform^] v1.3.4 or later is installed.

.Procedure
. In your web browser, open the {product-long-rhoas} (RHOAS) Terraform provider at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/redhat-developer/rhoas/latest.
. In the upper-right corner of Terraform provider registry, click *Use Provider*.
+
A pane opens that shows the configuration you need to use the RHOAS Terraform provider.
. In the pane that opened, copy the configuration shown. The following lines show an example of the configuration.
+

.Example RHOAS provider configuration
[source,shell]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rhoas = {
      source = "redhat-developer/rhoas"
      version = "0.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "rhoas" {
  #configuration options
}
----

. In your IDE, open a new file and paste the configuration you copied. You can specify configuration options in the provider section.
+

. Save the file as a Terraform configuration file called `main.tf` in a directory of your choice. This procedure uses a directory called `Terraform`.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Terraform` directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd Terraform
----
. Enter the following command. This command initializes the working directory that contains Terraform configuration files and installs any required plug-ins.

When the Terraform provider has been initialized, you see a confirmation message.

[id="proc-using-terraform_{context}"]
=== Using the {product-long-rhoas} (RHOAS) Terraform provider

Resources are the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resource block in a Terraform provider describes one or more infrastructure objects. For {product-long-kafka}, such infrastructure objects might include Kafka instances, service accounts, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and topics. The procedure that follows shows what resources you can add to your Terraform configuration file to create a Kafka instance and its associated resources such as service accounts and topics.

.Prerequisites

* You have a Red Hat account.
* You have an offline token that authenticates the Terraform resources with the OpenShift Application Services API.

[NOTE]
====
The offline token is a refresh token with no expiry and can be used by non-interactive processes to provide an access token for {product-long-rhoas} to authenticate the user. The token is an OpenShift offline token and you can find it at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token. Because the offline token is a sensitive value that varies between environments it is best specified as an `OFFLINE_TOKEN` environment variable when running `terraform apply` in a terminal. To set this environment variable, enter the following command in a terminal window, replacing _<offline_token>_ with the value of the offline token:
[source, subs="+quotes"]
----
export OFFLINE_TOKEN=<offline_token>
----
====

.Procedure

. Open the `main.tf` file in your IDE for editing.
. Copy the `rhoas_kafka` resource shown in the following example and paste it into the `main.tf` file after the provider configuration. This example uses the `"my-instance"` identifier and creates a Kafka instance called `my-instance`.
+
[NOTE]
In the following examples, the identifier and the name of the infrastructure object are the same for demonstration purposes only. You can choose different values for each field.
+

.Example `rhoas_kafka` resource
[source]
----
resource "rhoas_kafka" "my-instance" {
  name = "my-instance"
  plan = "developer.x1"
  billing_model = "standard"
}
  output "bootstrap_server_my-instance" {
    value = rhoas_kafka.my-instance.bootstrap_server_host
}

----
. Save your changes.
. Open a terminal and apply the changes you made to your Terraform provider configuration.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ terraform apply
----
+
In the terminal, Terraform displays a message that `rhoas_kafka.my-instance` will be created. Terraform automatically sets values for `cloud provider` and `region` in the terminal. All other information for the instance is provided by the Kafka APIs.
. When you're ready to create your instance,  type *yes*. The generated bootstrap server URL appears in the terminal as an output.
+
[NOTE]
Running `terraform apply` for the first time also creates the Terraform state file. Terraform logs information about the resources it has created in this state file. This allows Terraform to know which resources are under its control and when to update and delete them. The Terraform state file is named `terraform.tfstate` by default and is kept in the same directory where Terraform is run. Sensitive information such as the offline token, client ID, and client secret can be found in the `terraform.tfstate` file. Running `terraform apply` again updates this file.

. To verify Terraform successfully created your Kafka instance, in your web browser, open the *Kafka Instances* page of the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^].
. To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in {product-kafka}, you must first create a service account with credentials. To create a service account, copy and paste the  `rhoas_service_account` resource shown in the following example into the `main.tf` file. This example uses the `"my-service-account"` identifier and creates a service account called my-service-account.
+

.Example `rhoas_service_account` resource
[source]
----
resource "rhoas_service_account" "my-service-account" {
  name        = "my-service-account"
  description = "<description of service account>"
}

output "client_id" {
  value = rhoas_service_account.my-service-account.client_id
}

output "client_secret" {
  value     = rhoas_service_account.my-service-account.client_secret
  sensitive = true
}

. Apply the changes you made to your Terraform provider configuration.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ terraform apply
----
In the terminal, Terraform displays a message that `rhoas_service_account.my-service-account` will be created.
. When you're ready to create your service account, type *yes*. The generated client ID appears in the terminal as an output. The client secret does not appear because it is marked as a sensitive value.
. To verify Terraform successfully created your service account, in your web browser, open the *Service Accounts* page of the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^].
. To create a Kafka topic with default values, copy and paste the `rhoas_topic` resource shown in the following example into the `main.tf` file. This example uses the `topic` identifier and creates the `"my-topic"` Kafka topic. As you have already created the Kafka instance, Terraform can check dependencies for this new topic resource and knows the Kafka ID when you run this example resource.
+
.Example `rhoas_topic` resource with default values
[source]
----
resource "rhoas_topic" "topic" {
		name = "my-topic"
		partitions = 1
		kafka_id = rhoas_kafka.instance.id
	}

$ terraform apply
----
In the terminal, Terraform displays a message that `rhoas_topic.my-topic` will be created.
. When you're ready to create your topic, type *yes*.
. To verify Terraform successfully created your topic, in your web browser, open the *Topics* page of the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^].
. To create Access Control List (ACL) permissions with some default values, copy and paste the `rhoas_acl` resource shown in the following example into the `main.tf` file. This example uses the `"acl"` identifier. The following list describes each field in an ACL binding resource.

`resource_type`:: The type of resource you want access to. This example uses `“TOPIC”`.
`resource_name`:: The name of the resource you want access to. This example uses the name that is passed when creating the topic.
`pattern_type`:: The type of pattern of the ACL. This example uses the `LITERAL` pattern type meaning that Kafka will try to match the match the full resource name (the topic) with the resource specified in the ACL.
`principal`:: The user that this binding applies to. This example uses the service account client ID.
`operation_type`:: The type of operation (an action performed on a resource) that is allowed for the given user on this resource.
`permission_type`:: Whether permission is given or taken away.

+
.Example `ACL binding` resource
[source]
----
resource "rhoas_acl" "acl" {
  kafka_id = rhoas_kafka.my-instance.id
  resource_type = "TOPIC"
  resource_name = "my-topic"
  pattern_type = "LITERAL"
  principal = rhoas_service_account.my-service-account.client_id

=== Data sources

[role="_abstract"]
In Terraform, you can use data sources to obtain information about resources external to Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions using the data block. Apply data sources in the same way that you add resources to the configuration file. The following `rhoas_kafkas` https://registry.terraform.io/providers/redhat-developer/rhoas/latest/docs[data source] example provides a list of the Kafka instances accessible to your organization in {product-long-kafka}.

.Example `rhoas_kafkas` data source
[source]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rhoas = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/redhat-developer/rhoas"
      version = "0.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "rhoas" {}

data "rhoas_kafkas" "all" {
}

output "all_kafkas" {
  value = data.rhoas_kafkas.all
}
