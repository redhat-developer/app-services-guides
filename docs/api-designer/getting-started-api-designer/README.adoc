// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As an API owner or developer, you can use {product-long-api-designer} to design event schemas and API definitions that comply with vendor-neutral and portable open specifications.
{product-long-api-designer} is a managed cloud service that enables you to design schemas and API definitions without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own {product-api-designer} clusters.

For more overview information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_api-designer/1[{product-long-api-designer} user documentation^].

ifndef::community[]
.Prerequisites
* You have a {org-name} account.
* If you plan to store your designs in {product-long-registry}, you have a running {registry} instance (see {base-url}{getting-started-url-registry}[Getting started with {product-long-registry}^]).
//For more information about signing up, see *<@SME: Where to link?>*.
endif::[]

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

[id="proc-importing-schema-api-design_{context}"]
== Importing a schema or API design

[role="_abstract"]
You can import an event schema or API definition into {product-long-api-designer} from a URL, from a file, or from an {product-long-registry} instance.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-long-api-designer} web console at {service-url-api-designer}[^].
* You can access a running {product-registry} instance in your organization, if you want to import from {product-long-registry}.
For more information, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-registry}[Getting started with {product-long-registry}^].

.Procedure
. In the {service-url-api-designer}[{product-long-api-designer} web console^], click *Import a schema or API design*, and then click one of the following options:
.. *Import from file*: Click *Browse* and select a file, or drag and drop a file.
.. *Import from URL*: Enter a valid and accessible URL.
.. *Import from {registry}*: From the instances list, select a {registry} instance.
Browse the list of artifacts for that instance, and select an artifact.
. When prompted, provide additional information such as version (_OpenAPI only_), name, type, and summary in the import dialog. You can overwrite any autopopulated values.
. Click *Import*.
The design editor opens automatically.

When you finish editing, you can export the updated design to {registry} as a new artifact or as a new version of the existing artifact.
You can export the design from the design editor or from the *API and Schema Designs* page.
You can also save your changes locally, or download the content to a file.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the imported design listed on the designs page?
* Are the design details correct?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the imported design is listed on the designs page.

endif::[]

[id="proc-testing-schema-api-design_{context}"]
== Testing a schema or API design

[role="_abstract"]
You can test that your schema or API design content is valid and compatible with existing content by applying the rules of an existing {product-long-registry} instance.
You can test the design while working in the {product-long-api-designer} editor, without exporting the design to {product-long-registry}.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-long-api-designer} web console at {service-url-api-designer}[^].
* You've created or imported an {product-api-designer} design.
* You can access a running {product-registry} instance in your organization.
Within that instance, you know the artifact ID of an artifact with the required rules configured.
For more information, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-registry}[Getting started with {product-long-registry}^].

.Procedure
. In the *API and Schema Designs* page of the {service-url-api-designer}[{product-long-api-designer} web console^], select the design that you want to test.
. Click *Edit* to open the design editor.
. From the *Actions* menu, click *Test using Service Registry*.
. From the *Registry instance* list, select a {registry} instance.
. Specify the artifact details in the *Group* and *Artifact ID* fields.
. Click *Test*.
+
NOTE: Note that the UI text is in flux and might change.

The test results are shown in a new pane in the design editor window:

* If the results page is blank, the content obeys the specified rules.

* If the results page provides details of any issues, resolve the issues and click *Retry* to retest the content using the same rules.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the test results pane shown in the design editor?
* Are the test results correct?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the test results pane is shown in the design editor.
. Verify that the test results are correct.
endif::[]

[id="proc-exporting-schema-api-design_{context}"]
== Exporting a schema or API design

[role="_abstract"]
When you're happy with your changes to an {product-long-api-designer} event schema or API definition, and you want to use the design in your application, you can export the content to an existing {product-long-registry} instance.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-long-api-designer} web console at {service-url-api-designer}[^].
* You've created or imported an {product-api-designer} design.
* You can access a running {product-registry} instance in your organization.
For more information, see {base-url}{getting-started-url-registry}[Getting started with {product-long-registry}^].

.Procedure
. In the *API and Schema Designs* page of the {service-url-api-designer}[{product-long-api-designer} web console^], select the design that you want to export.
. Click the options icon (three vertical dots), and click *Export to {registry}*.
. Complete the form to specify where to save the new design.
+
NOTE: If the design was originally imported from {product-long-registry}, the fields are prepopulated with the details of the original {product-registry} instance, and the *Version* is incremented.
+
.. *Registry instance*: Select the required instance from the list.
.. *Group*: _Optional:_ Enter a unique group name such as `my-org` to organize the artifact in a named collection.
Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization.
+
NOTE:  Specifying a group is optional when using the web console: {registry} generates a `default` group automatically.
+
.. *Artifact ID*: _Optional:_ Enter a unique ID for this artifact, such as `my-ID`.
If you don't specify a unique artifact ID, {registry} generates one automatically as a UUID.
.. *Version*:  _Optional:_ Specify the version number.
If you don't specify a version number, {registry} sets the version to 1.
+
[.screencapture]
.Exporting an API design
image::export-api-designer-design.png[Image of page to export an API design]
+
. Click *Export*.
The exported design is listed on the artifacts page of the specified {registry} instance.

You can manage {product-long-api-designer} design versions in {product-long-registry}.
You can also download {product-api-designer} designs to a file, either for local client code generation or to import the designs into {product-long-api-management}.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the design listed as an artifact in {product-long-registry}?
* Are the artifact details correct?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the design is listed as an artifact in {product-long-registry}.
* Verify that the artifact details are correct.
