[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-long-registry} web console to create and configure a {registry} instance for your applications or services. A {registry} instance is an isolated virtual tenant in a multi-tenanted deployment with its own unique instance URL and configuration to connect to producer and consumer applications.
