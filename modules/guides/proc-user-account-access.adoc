= Allowing users to view other user accounts
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
As an organization administrator, you can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the {org-name} Hybrid Cloud Console  to allow users to view other users in an organization.

You set up access by assigning a predefined role called `User Access principal viewer` to a user group.
By assigning the role, users in the group can do the following tasks:

* View and select other users when changing owners and managing access to {registry} instances in the {registry} web console.
* Specify user names when managing {registry} instances using the `rhoas` CLI for {product-long-registry}.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {registry} web console at {service-url-registry}[^] as an organization administrator.
* A user group is created that contains the users to assign the role to.

NOTE: If you want to add the `User Access principal viewer` role to a single user, create a new group for that user only.
