[role="_abstract"]
Use the {product-long-kafka} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services. A Kafka instance in {product-kafka} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configuration details needed for producers and consumers to connect to the instance.

.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product-kafka} web console at {service-url-kafka}[^].
* You're familiar with the different Kafka instance sizes that you can create in {product-kafka}, and the capacities that correspond to those sizes. For more information about the capacities and service limits of your Kafka instance, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5979061[Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka Service Limits].
endif::[]

.Procedure
. On the *Kafka Instances* page of the {product-kafka} {service-url-kafka}[web console^], click *Create Kafka instance*.
. Complete the *Create a Kafka instance* form to define the following instance details. Some instance details currently have only one option.
* *Instance name*: Enter a unique name for the Kafka instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
* *Cloud provider*: Accept the default value of *Amazon Web Services*.
* *Cloud region*: Select a cloud provider region from the list.
* *Availability zones*: The selection for availability zones is preconfigured as *Multi* for a production instance and *Single* for a trial instance.
* *Size*: If you've purchased a subscription for {product-kafka}, use the slider to select an instance size. In {product-kafka}, you can create Kafka instances of 1 or 2 streaming units depending on the capacity required. If you're creating a trial instance, the instance size is preconfigured.

NOTE: Although you can see Kafka instances created by other users in your organization, you might not be able to manage or connect to those instances. Only the instance owner or users with permissions to access the instance can edit or delete the instance, access the associated service account and topics, or connect to the instance.
