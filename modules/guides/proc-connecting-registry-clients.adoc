= Connecting client applications to {registry}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
To connect your applications or services to a {registry} instance in the web console, you must copy and save the {registry} instance URL, create a service account, and copy and save the generated credentials. You'll use these details later when you configure your application for {registry}.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a {registry} instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. On the *{registry} Instances* page of the web console, for the instance that you want to connect to, select the options icon (three vertical dots), and click *Connection*.
. Depending on the client libraries that you want to use, choose the API for your needs:
+
 * *Core Registry API* is the most powerful API and works with Apicurio client libraries.
 * *Schema Registry compatibility API* provides compatibility with the Confluent Schema Registry API.
 * *CNCF Schema Registry API* provides compatibility with the CNCF specification.

. On the *Connection* page, copy the *Core Registry API* URL, or one of the other API URLs if you are using a different client, to a secure location. You'll use this server endpoint to connect to this {registry} instance.

. Under *Service Accounts*, click *Create service account* to generate the credentials that you can use to connect applications to {registry} and Kafka instances.

. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client secret* to a secure location.
+
IMPORTANT: The generated credentials are displayed only one time. Ensure that you've successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window.

. After you save the generated credentials to a secure location, select the confirmation check box in the credentials window and close the window.

. For the *Authentication method*, copy the OAuth *Token endpoint URL* to a secure location. You’ll use this endpoint with your service account credentials to authenticate the connection to this {registry} instance.
+
NOTE: HTTP Basic authentication is also available for tools and libraries that don't support OAuth, but OAuth is recommended whenever possible. With HTTP Basic, you use only the service account credentials to authenticate the connection to the {registry} instance.

+
You’ll use the service account information that you saved to configure your applications to connect to your {registry} instances later when you're ready.
+
For example, if you plan to use https://github.com/edenhill/kcat[kcat^] to interact with your Kafka instance and deserialize Avro messages using {registry}, you'll use this information to set your {registry} URL in the client environment variables.
+
To review your service account information, reset your credentials, or delete the service account, use the left navigation menu to go to the *Service Accounts* page.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you save the {registry} instance URL to a secure location?
* Did you save the client credentials to a secure location?
* Did you verify that your service account was successfully created on the *Service Accounts* page?
