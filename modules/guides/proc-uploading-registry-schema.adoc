= Uploading a schema to {registry}

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a {registry} instance, you can upload schema or API content to the instance. The following example shows uploading an Apache Avro schema for serializing and deserializing Kafka messages in client applications.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a {registry} instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *{registry}* instances page of the web console, select the {registry} instance that you want to upload a schema to.
. Click *Upload artifact* and complete the form to define the schema details:

+
* *Group*: Enter an optional unique group name such as `my-org` to organize the artifact in a named collection. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization.
+
NOTE:  Specifying a group is optional when using the web console, and a `default` group is automatically created. When using the REST API or Maven plug-in, you can specify the `default` group in the API path if you do not want to create a unique group.
+
* *ID*: Enter an optional unique ID for this artifact such as `my-ID`. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, {registry} generates one automatically as a UUID.
* *Type*: Use the default *Auto-Detect* setting to automatically detect the artifact type, or select the artifact type from the drop-down, for example, Avro Schema or OpenAPI.
* *Artifact*: Drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload a file. For this example, copy and paste the following simple Avro schema:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{
"type": "record",
"namespace": "com.example",
"name": "FullName",
"fields": [
{ "name": "first", "type": "string" },
{ "name": "last", "type": "string" }
]}
----

. Click *Upload* to complete the operation and display the new artifact details:

* *Info*: Displays the artifact name, group, description, lifecycle status, when created, and last modified. Click the *Edit Artifact Metadata* pencil icon to edit the artifact name and description or add labels, or click *Download* to download the artifact file locally.
* *Content*: Displays a read-only view of the full artifact content.
* *Documentation*: (OpenAPI only): Displays automatically-generated REST API documentation.
* *Content Rules*: Displays artifact content rules that you can enable and configure. You can configure a *Validity Rule* or *Compatibility Rule* by selecting the appropriate rule configuration from the drop-down. For details on supported rules, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_service_registry/1[{registry-product-long} user documentation].
+
You can now use this schema to serialize and deserialize messages from Kafka client applications.

. On the right of the screen, you can click *Upload new version* to add a new artifact version.

. You can click *Delete* to delete an artifact as needed.
+
IMPORTANT: Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone. Artifact versions are immutable and cannot be deleted individually.
