= Uploading a schema to {registry}
:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a {registry} instance, you can upload schema or API content to the instance. The following example shows uploading an Apache Avro schema for serializing and deserializing Kafka messages in client applications.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a {registry} instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. On the *{registry} Instances* page of the web console, select the {registry} instance that you want to upload a schema to.
. Click *Upload artifact* and complete the form to define the schema details:

+
* *Group*: Enter an optional unique group name such as `my-org` to organize the artifact in a named collection. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization.
+
NOTE: Specifying a group is optional when using the web console, and a `default` group is automatically created.
+
* *ID*: Enter an optional unique ID for this artifact such as `my-ID`. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, {registry} generates one automatically as a UUID.
* *Type*: Use the default *Auto-Detect* setting to automatically detect the artifact type, or select the artifact type from the list, for example, Avro Schema or OpenAPI.
* *Artifact*: Drag and drop or click *Browse* to upload a file. For this example, copy and paste the following simple Avro schema:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{
  "type": "record",
  "namespace": "com.example",
  "name": "FullName",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "first",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "last",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
----

. Click *Upload* to complete the operation and display the new artifact details:

* *Overview* tab:
** *Version metadata*: Displays details such as the artifact name, artifact ID, global ID, content ID, labels, properties, and so on.
** *Content rules*: Displays artifact content rules that you can enable and configure. You can configure a *Validity rule* or *Compatibility rule* by enabling the rule and then selecting the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For details on supported rules, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_service_registry/1[{product-long-registry} user documentation^].
* *Documentation* tab: (OpenAPI only): Displays automatically-generated REST API documentation.
* *Content* tab: Displays a read-only view of the full artifact content.

+
You can now use this schema to serialize and deserialize messages from Kafka client applications.

. You can click *Upload new version* to add a new artifact version.

. You can click *Delete* to delete an artifact as needed.
+
IMPORTANT: Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone. Artifact versions are immutable and cannot be deleted individually.

. To show the list of artifacts on the *Artifacts* tab, click the _instance-name_ breadcrumb.
