:imagesdir: ../_images

[role="_abstract"]
After you create a service account for applications to connect to a {registry} instance, you must also set the appropriate level of access for the new account on the *Access* tab of the {registry} instance. {registry} uses role-based access to enable you to manage how other user accounts and service accounts can interact with the {registry} instance that you create.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a {registry} instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.
* You've created a service account that you want to allow to access the running {registry} instance.

.Procedure
. On the *{registry} Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the {registry} instance that you want the service account to access.
. Click the *Access* tab to view the accounts and roles already assigned for this instance.
. Click *Grant access* to assign a role to the service account.
. In the *Account* field, select or enter the service account name that you want to assign the role to.
. Select the *Role* that you want to assign to the account, for example, *Manager* for write access to this instance.
. Click *Save* to finish.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the new role for the service account listed on the *Access* page of the {registry} instance?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the new role for the service account is listed on the *Access* page of the {registry} instance.
endif::[]
