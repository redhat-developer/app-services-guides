// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

image::sak-crc-resource-center.png[Image of Resource Center in web console]

The center of the page shows you the list of Kafka instances that are currently running within your organisation. If this is your, or your organisations, first interaction with {Product_short}, this list will be empty.

[id="proc-creating-service-account_{context}"]
== Creating a service account to connect to a Kafka instance in {product}

To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in the {product} web console, you need to create a service account that's associated with the instance. You also need to save the bootstrap server endpoint for the instance, the generated service account credentials, and the authentication token endpoint to a secure location. You'll use the service account and Kafka instance information later when you configure your application.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, for the relevant Kafka instance that you want to connect to, select the options icon (three vertical dots) and click *Connection*.
. In the *Connection* page, copy the *Bootstrap server* endpoint to a secure location. This is the bootstrap server endpoint that you'll need for connecting to this Kafka instance.
. Click *Create service account* to set up the account that you'll use to access this Kafka instance.
. Enter a unique service account name, such as `my-service-account`, add an optional description, and click *Create*.
. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to a secure location. These are the credentials that you'll use to connect to this Kafka instance.
+
IMPORTANT: The generated credentials are displayed only one time, so ensure that you've successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window.

. After you save the generated credentials to a secure location, select the confirmation check box in the credentials window and close the window.
. For the *Authentication method*, copy the SASL/OAUTHBEARER *Token endpoint URL* to a secure location. This is the endpoint that you'll use with your service account credentials to authenticate the connection to this Kafka instance.
+
NOTE: SASL/PLAIN authentication is also available for tools and libraries that don't support SASL/OAUTHBEARER, but SASL/OAUTHBEARER is recommended whenever possible. With SASL/PLAIN authentication, you use only the service account credentials to authenticate the connection to the Kafka instance.

+
You'll use the service account information that you saved to configure your application to connect to your Kafka instances when you're ready. For example, if you plan to use https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[Kafkacat^] to interact with your Kafka instance, you'll use this information to set your bootstrap server and client environment variables.
. To review your service account information, reset your credentials, or delete the service account, use the left navigation menu to go to the *Service Accounts* page.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you save the bootstrap server, client credentials, and authentication token endpoint to a secure location?
* Did you verify that your service account was successfully created in the *Service Accounts* page?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the bootstrap server, client credentials, and authentication token endpoint are saved to a secure location.
. Verify that your service account was successfully created in the *Service Accounts* page.
endif::[]

[id="proc-setting-service-account-permissions_{context}"]
== Setting permissions for a service account in a Kafka instance in {product}

After you create a service account to connect to a Kafka instance, you must also set the appropriate level of access for that new account in the Access Control List (ACL) of the Kafka instance. {product} uses ACLs provided by Kafka that enable you to manage how other user accounts and service accounts are permitted to interact with the Kafka resources that you create.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.
* You've created a service account that you want to allow to access the running Kafka instance.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want the service account to access.
. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL for this instance.
. Click *Manage access*, use the *Account* drop-down menu to select the service account that you previously created, and click *Next*.
. Under *Assign Permissions*, use the drop-down menus to set the permissions shown in the following table for this service account. Click *Add* to add each new resource permission.
+
--
These permissions enable applications associated with the service account to create and delete topics in the instance, to produce and consume messages in any topic in the instance, and to use any consumer group and any producer.

.Example ACL permissions for a new service account
[cols="25%,25%,25%,25%"]
|===
h|Resource type
h|Resource identifier and value
h|Access type
h|Operation

|`Topic`
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`All`

|`Consumer group`
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`Read`

|`Transactional ID`
|`Is` = `*`
|`Allow`
|`All`
|===
--
. After you add these permissions for the service account, click *Save* to finish.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Are the new permissions for the service account listed in the *Access* page of the Kafka instance?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the new permissions for the service account are listed in the *Access* page of the Kafka instance.

[id="proc-creating-kafka-topic_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka topic in {product}

After you create a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Select the *Topics* tab, click *Create topic*, and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.
+
--
[.screencapture]
.Guided steps to define topic details
image::sak-create-topic.png[Image of wizard to create a topic]

* *Topic name*: Enter a unique topic name, such as `my-first-kafka-topic`.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partition to `1` for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time and size to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention time to `A week` and the retention size to `Unlimited`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy. Retention size is the maximum total size of all log segments in a partition before they are deleted or compacted.
* *Replicas*: For this release of {product}, the replicas are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to `3` and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to `2`. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.

After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table. You can now start producing and consuming messages to and from this topic using services that you connect to this instance.
--
. In the topics table, on the right side of the Kafka topic, use the options icon (three vertical dots) to edit or delete the topic as needed.
+

[id="proc-viewing-metrics_{context}"]
== Viewing metrics for a Kafka instance in {product}

After you create Kafka topics in your Kafka instance, you can start producing and consuming messages using methods such as link:https://kafka.apache.org/downloads[Kafka] scripts, link:https://github.com/edenhill/kcat[Kafkacat], or a link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] application.
ifdef::qs[You'll learn in the next quick starts how to connect applications to produce and consume messages.]
ifndef::qs[For example, to use Kafka scripts to produce and consume messages, see {base-url}{kafka-bin-scripts-url}[_Configuring and connecting Kafka scripts with {product-long}_^].]

After you produce and consume messages in your services, you can return to the Kafka instance in the web console and use the *Dashboard* page to view metrics for the instance and topics. The metrics help you understand the performance and data usage for your Kafka instance and topics.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.
* You've created topics in your Kafka instance.

.Procedure
* In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, click the name of the Kafka instance and select the *Dashboard* tab.
+
--
When you create your Kafka instance and topics, the *Dashboard* page is initially empty. After you start producing and consuming messages in your services, you can return to this page to view related metrics.

NOTE: In some cases, after you start producing and consuming messages, you might need to wait several minutes for the latest metrics to appear. You might also need to wait until your instance and topics contain enough data for metrics to appear.

--

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you note how to navigate to the instance *Dashboard* page to view metrics later?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that you know how to navigate to the instance *Dashboard* page to view metrics later.
