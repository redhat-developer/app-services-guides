{product-long} is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users should not use Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.
====

// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use {product-long} to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. {product} is a managed cloud service that enables you to add Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

//For more overview information about {product}, see [variablized link to overview here https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/].

[id="proc-creating-kafka-instance_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka instance in {product}

Use the {product} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services. A Kafka instance in {product} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configurations needed to connect to producer and consumer services.

ifndef::qs[]
.Prerequisites
* You're logged in to the {product} web console at {service-url}.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In the {product} web console, go to *Streams for Apache Kafka* > *Kafka Instances* and click *Create Kafka instance*.
. Enter a unique *Instance name*, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`. For this release of {product}, all other fields are preconfigured.
+
////
//For post preview, when more options are available.
. In the *Streams for Apache Kafka* page of the web console, click *Create Kafka instance* and define the following instance details. Some values currently have only one option.
* *Instance name*: Enter a unique name for the instance, such as `my-first-kafka-instance`.
* *Cloud provider*: Select `Amazon Web Services`.
* *Cloud region*: Select `US East, N. Virginia`.
* *Availability zones*: Select `Multi`.
////
. Click *Create instance* to start the creation process for your Kafka instance.

// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick Starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

image::sak-crc-resource-center.png[Image of Resource Center in web console]

The center of the page shows you the list of Kafka instances that are currently running within your organisation. If this is your, or your organisations, first interaction with {Product_short}, this list will be empty.

[id="proc-creating-service-account_{context}"]
== Creating a service account to connect to a Kafka instance in {product}

To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in the {product} web console, you need to create a service account, copy and save the generated credentials, and copy and save the bootstrap server endpoint. You'll use the service account information later when you configure your application.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, for the relevant Kafka instance that you want to connect to, select the options icon (three vertical dots) and click *View connection information*.
. In the *Connection* page, copy the *Bootstrap server* endpoint to a secure location. This is the bootstrap server endpoint that you'll need for connecting to this Kafka instance.
. Click *Create service account* to generate the credentials that you'll use to connect to this Kafka instance.
. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to a secure location.
+
IMPORTANT: The generated credentials are displayed only one time, so ensure that you've successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window.

. After you save the generated credentials to a secure location, select the confirmation check box in the credentials window and close the window.
. For the *Authentication method*, copy the SASL/OAUTHBEARER *Token endpoint URL* to a secure location. This is the endpoint that you'll use with your service account credentials to authenticate the connection to this Kafka instance.
+
NOTE: SASL/PLAIN authentication is also available for tools and libraries that don't support SASL/OAUTHBEARER, but SASL/OAUTHBEARER is recommended whenever possible. With SASL/PLAIN authentication, you use only the service account credentials to authenticate the connection to the Kafka instance.

+
You'll use the server and client information that you saved to configure your application to connect to your Kafka instances when you're ready. For example, if you plan to use https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[Kafkacat^] to interact with your Kafka instance, you'll use this information to set your bootstrap server and client environment variables.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you save the bootstrap server endpoint to a secure location?
* Did you save the client credentials to a secure location?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the bootstrap server endpoint is saved to a secure location.
. Verify that the client credentials are saved to a secure location.
endif::[]

[id="proc-creating-kafka-topic_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka topic in {product}

After you create a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services.

.Prerequisites
* You've created a Kafka instance and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Kafka Instances* page of the web console, select the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.
+

.Guided steps to define topic details
image::sak-create-topic.png[Image of wizard to create a topic]

* *Topic name*: Enter a unique topic name, such as `my-first-kafka-topic`.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partition to `1` for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
+
NOTE: You can increase the number of partitions later, but you cannot decrease them.
+

* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention to `7 days`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy.
* *Replicas*: Set the number of partition replicas for the topic and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader. This example sets the replica factor and in-sync replicas to `1`. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.

After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table. You can now start producing and consuming messages to and from this topic using services that you connect to this instance.
--
. In the topics table, on the right side of the Kafka topic, use the options icon (three vertical dots) to edit or delete the topic as needed.
