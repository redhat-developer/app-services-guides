== Creating Managed Kafka Using rhoas CLI

This guide illustrates how you can create and generate connection
details for your Managed Kafka instance.

NOTE: This guide uses `rhoas` CLI, however users can also execute the same steps in cloud.redhat.com website.


=== Prequisites

* You must have the https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/cli/blob/master/docs/guides/getting-started.adoc[rhoas CLI installed]
* Valid account in cloud.redhat.com

=== Logging in

You can follow https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/cli/blob/master/docs/guides/logging-in.adoc[this guide] to log in to the CLI.

=== Creating a Managed Kafka instance

First you need a Kafka instance. You can follow the instructions to
create one.

[source,bash]
----
rhoas kafka create <your-instance-name>
----

Wait a couple of seconds for the instance to provision.

=== Retrieve Bootstrap URL

[source,bash]
----
echo $(rhoas kafka describe | jq .id -r)
echo $(rhoas kafka describe | jq .bootstrapServerHost -r)
----

NOTE: See https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/cli/blob/master/docs/guides/using-the-cli.adoc[Using the CLI] for more Kafka related commands.

=== Create credentials that will be used to connect to instance

[source,bash]
----
rhoas serviceaccount create --name=<your-svc-account-name> --file-format env
----

This will generate a `.env` file with content that should look as follows:

[source,env]
----
USER=srvc-acct-fdsfdsf
PASSWORD=323fsdf23-fgdsgdffsadsa
----
