            "OpenShift® Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple Kubernetes distributions by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.\n* OpenShift Pipelines is a serverless CI/CD system that runs pipelines with all the required dependencies in isolated containers.\n* They are designed for decentralized teams that work on a microservice-based architecture.\n* They are defined using standard Custom Resource Definitions making them extensible and easy to integrate with the existing Kubernetes tools. This enables you to scale on-demand.\n* You can use OpenShift Pipelines to build images with Kubernetes tools such as Source-to-Image (S2I), Buildah, Buildpacks, and Kaniko that are portable across any Kubernetes platform.\n* You can use the Developer perspective to create and manage pipelines and view logs in your namespaces.\n\nTo start using Pipelines, install the OpenShift® Pipelines Operator on your cluster."
