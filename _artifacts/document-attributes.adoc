// These attributes are injected into each content file and override any edits made to the attriutes in the content files. To add or update attributes, edit this source file directly.
// Attributes MUST appear below the document title
// Do not delete attributes with identical values, such as :product-long: and :product:. These are intentional because although they are identical here, they are not in other renderings of this source file.
