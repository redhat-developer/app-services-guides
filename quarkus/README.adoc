Learn how to use Quarkus to produce messages to and consume messages from a Kafka instance in {product-long}.

[#introduction]
Welcome to the {product-long} Quarkus quick start. In this quick start, you'll learn how to use link:{quarkus_url}[{quarkus}] to produce messages to and consume messages from your Kafka instances in {product-long}.

[id="proc-getting-the-sample-code_{context}"]
== Getting the same code

{quarkus} is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Applications built for Quarkus can produce messages to and consume messages to {product} using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.

In order to follow this quick start get the sample from GitHub and open it in your IDE.

.Procedure
. On the command line use git to clone the sample.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
$ mkdir guides && git clone {samples_git_repo} .
----
+
. Using your IDE, import the `guides/quarkus` directory that you created in the previous step.

ifdef::qs[]
.Verification
* You have the quarkus project imported into your IDE and the IDE has configured the project with the needed Java libraries from the Maven `pom.xml`.
endif::[]

[id="proc-configuring-quarkus_{context}"]
== Configuring your {quarkus} application to connect to a Kafka instance

To enable your Quarkus application to access a Kafka instance, you must configure the connection using the bootstrap server endpoint and the generated credentials for your {product} service account. For Quarkus, you can configure connection information by using the `application.properties` configuration file. This example sets environment variables and then references them in `application.properties`.

For more information about Quarkus configuration options for using Kafka with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, see https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka[the guide] in the {quarkus} documentation.

.Prerequisites
* You have the bootstrap server endpoint (external server endpoint) and the generated credentials for your service account. You retrieved this information previously for the Kafka instance in {product} by selecting the options menu (three vertical dots), clicking *Connect to instance*, and generating the service account.

.Procedure
. On the command line, enter the following commands to set the Kafka instance bootstrap server and client credentials as environment variables to be used by Quarkus or other applications. Replace the values with your own server and credential information.
+
.Setting environment variables for server and credentials
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
export BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=__<bootstrap_server>__
export CLIENT_ID=__<client_id>__
export CLIENT_SECRET=__<client_secret>__
export OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URI=__<oauth_token_endpoint_uri>__
----
+
. Review the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to understand how the environment variables you set in the previous step are used in your application.

[id="proc-create-prices-topic_{context}"]
== Create the prices topic

This example uses a topic called `prices`

.Prerequisites
* You have created a Kafka instance in the {product} web console and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Procedure
. In the *Streams for Apache Kafka* page of the web console, select the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.
. Click *Create topic* and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click *Next* to complete each step and click *Finish* to complete the setup.
+
[.screencapture]
.Guided steps to define topic details
image::sak-create-topic.png[Image of wizard to create a topic]

* *Topic name*: Enter `prices` as the topic name.
* *Partitions*: Set the number of partitions for this topic. This example sets the partition to `1` for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.
+
NOTE: You can increase the number of partitions later, but you cannot decrease them.
+

* *Message retention*: Set the message retention time to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention to `7 days`. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy.

After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table. You can now start producing and consuming messages to and from this topic using the sample {quarkus} application that you connect to this instance.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the new Kafka topic `prices` listed in the topics table?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the new Kafka topic `prices` is listed in the topics table.
endif::[]


[id="proc-running-the-quarkus-application_{context}"]
== Running the {quarkus} application

This example is a small Quarkus application. It has three application scoped beans, one of which generates a random number between 0 and 100 and produces it to a Kafka topic, another that consumes it from the Kafka topic, and a final bean that exposes it as a REST UI (using Server Sent events).

.Prerequisites
* You have a running Kafka instance in {product}.
* You have link:https://github.com/git-guides/[git] installed
* You have an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Java[IDE] like link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA], link:https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse], link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[VSCode] or even link:https://spacevim.org/use-vim-as-a-java-ide/[Vim] or link:http://spacemacs.org/[Emacs]!
* You need a link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[JDK 8 (8u262-b10 or later) or 11+] (any distribution)
* You need link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven 3.6.2+]

.Procedure
. On the command line, enter the following commands to run the application using Quarkus:
[source, bash]
----
$ ./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

.Verification
. Check that there are no error messages being produced by {quarkus}
. Visit link:http://localhost:8080/prices.html[] and check that the Last price updates
ifdef::qs[]

[#conclusion]
Congratulations! You successfully completed the {product} {quarkus} quick start, and are now ready to add {product} to your own {quarkus} application.
