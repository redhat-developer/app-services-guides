// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use {product-long-connectors} to create and configure connections between {product-long-kafka} and third-party systems.

In this example, you connect a data source (a data generator) that creates Kafka messages and a data sink (an HTTP endpoint) that consumes the Kafka messages.

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

[#introduction]
====
Welcome to the quick start for {product-long-connectors}.

In this quick start, you learn how to create a source connector and sink connector and send data to and from {product-kafka}.

A _source_ connector allows you to send data from an external system to {product-kafka}.

A _sink_ connector allows you to send data from {product-kafka} to an external system.
