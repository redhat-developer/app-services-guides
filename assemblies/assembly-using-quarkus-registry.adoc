// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can connect Quarkus applications to Kafka instances in {product-long-kafka} and {registry} instances in {product-long-registry}. This feature makes it easy for development teams to store and reuse schemas in event-streaming architectures.

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] is a Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, and optimized for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments. Quarkus is designed to work with popular Java standards, frameworks, and libraries such as Eclipse MicroProfile and Spring, as well as Apache Kafka, RESTEasy (JAX-RS), Hibernate ORM (JPA), Infinispan, Camel, and many more.

In this quick start, you manually configure connections from an example Quarkus application to Kafka and {registry} instances. The application uses the Kafka instance to produce and consume messages and a schema stored in the {registry} instance to serialize/deserialize the messages.

NOTE: When you've completed this quick start and understand the required connection configurations for Kafka and {registry} instances, you can use the {product-long-rhoas} command-line interface (CLI) to generate these types of configurations in a more automated way. To learn more, see {base-url}{service-contexts-url-cli}[Connecting client applications to {product-long-rhoas} using the rhoas CLI^].

// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

[#introduction]
====
Welcome to the quick start for {product-long-registry} with Quarkus. In this quick start, you learn how to manually connect an example https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^] application to a Kafka instance in {product-long-kafka} and a {registry} instance in {product-registry}. The application uses the Kafka instance to produce and consume messages and a schema stored in the {registry} instance to serialize/deserialize the messages.
