[role="_abstract"]
With the {product-long-rhoas} `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI), you can manage {product-long-registry} from a terminal.

As a developer of applications and services,
you can use `rhoas` to create {registry} instances and connect your applications and services to these instances.
You can also manage artifacts.
Artifacts are items stored in {registry}, such as schemas and API specifications.
