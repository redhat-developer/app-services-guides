[IMPORTANT]
====
The `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI) is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users should not use Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads. Limited documentation is available for Development Preview releases and is typically focused on fundamental user goals.
====

[role="_abstract"]
With the `rhoas` command-line interface (CLI), you can manage your application services from a terminal.

This guide describes how to get started quickly by doing the following:

--
* Install `rhoas` on your Operating System.

* Configure `rhoas` to enable command completion.

* Start using `rhoas` by creating a simple Kafka instance, connecting to it, and creating a Kafka topic to produce and consume messages.

[id="proc-configuring-rhoas_{context}"]
== Configuring rhoas

[role="_abstract"]
After you install the `rhoas` CLI,
you can enable command completion to automatically complete `rhoas` commands or suggest options when you press *Tab*.

NOTE: The procedure for enabling command completion depends on the shell you are using.
To determine which shell you are using, run the `echo $0` command.

You can enable command completion for each of the following shells:

* xref:_enabling_command_completion_on_bash[Bash]
* xref:_enabling_command_completion_on_zsh[Zsh]
* xref:_enabling_command_completion_on_fish[Fish]

----
--

[id="proc-using-rhoas_{context}"]
== Using rhoas

[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services,
you can use `rhoas` to create Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances.

The following procedures demonstrate a basic workflow to get started quickly:

* xref:_creating_a_kafka_instance[Create a Kafka instance]

* xref:_creating_a_service_account[Create a service account]

* xref:_creating_a_kafka_topic[Create a Kafka topic]

* xref:_commands_for_managing_kafka[Use `rhoas` to manage your Kafka instances, service accounts, and Kafka topics]

=== Creating a Kafka instance

A Kafka instance includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and other required configurations for connecting to Kafka producer and consumer services.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to `rhoas`.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to create a Kafka instance with default values.
+
--
This example creates a Kafka instance called `my-kafka`.

.Creating a Kafka instance
[source,shell]
----
$ rhoas kafka create my-kafka
Kafka instance "my-kafka" created successfully
{
  "cloud_provider": "aws",
  "created_at": "2021-03-17T18:33:50.000799005Z",
  "href": "/api/managed-services-api/v1/kafkas/1ptcsACdx7HVzacKZBA6HRRa1oW",
  "id": "1ptcsACdx7HVzacKZBA6HRRa1oW",
  "kind": "Kafka",
  "multi_az": true,
  "name": "my-kafka",
  "owner": "developer",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "status": "accepted",
  "updated_at": "2021-03-17T18:33:50.000799005Z"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to use the default values,
enter the following command: `rhoas kafka create`.
You will be prompted to enter the `Name`, `Cloud Provider`, and `Cloud Region` for the Kafka instance.
====
--

. Enter the following command to verify that the Kafka instance is ready to use.
+
--
This command shows that the Kafka instance is ready to use,
because the `Status` field is `ready`.

.Reviewing details of a Kafka instance
[source,shell]
----
$ rhoas status kafka

  Kafka
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ID:                     1ptdfZRHmLKwqW6A3YKM2MawgDh
  Name:                   my-kafka
  Status:                 ready
  Bootstrap URL:          my-kafka--ptdfzrhmlkwqw-a-ykm-mawgdh.kafka.devshift.org:443
----

[NOTE]
====
When you created the Kafka instance, it was set as the current instance automatically.
If you have multiple Kafka instances,
you can switch to a different instance by using the `rhoas kafka use` command.
====
--

=== Creating a service account

To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance, you must first create a service account with credentials.
The credentials are exported to a file on your computer,
which you can use to authenticate your application with your Kafka instance.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a Kafka instance, and it has a `ready` status.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to create a service account.
+
--
This example creates a service account called `my-service-acct` and saves the credentials in a JSON file.

.Creating a service account
[source,shell]
----
$ rhoas serviceaccount create --name "my-service-acct" --file-format json

Service account my-service-account created
Credentials saved to /home/developer/my-project/credentials.json
----

Your service account credentials are created and saved to a JSON file.

[NOTE]
====
When creating a service account, you can choose the file format and location to save the credentials.
For more information, see the `rhoas serviceaccount create` command help.
====
--

. To verify your service account credentials,
view the `credentials.json` file that you created.
+
--
.Verifying service account credentials
[source,shell]
----
$ cat credentials.json
{
	"user":"srvc-acct-eb575691-b94a-41f1-ab97-50ade0cd1094",
	"password":"facf3df1-3c8d-4253-aa87-8c95ca5e1225"
}
----

You'll use these credentials and the bootstrap server URL to connect your applications and services to your Kafka instance.
--

=== Creating a Kafka topic

After creating a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a Kafka instance, and it has a `ready` status.

.Procedure

. Verify that you are using the Kafka instance that you created.
+
--
This example switches to the `my-kafka` instance that was previously created.

.Selecting a Kafka instance to use
[source,shell]
----
$ rhoas kafka use my-kafka
Kafka instance "my-kafka" has been set as the current instance.
----
--

. Create a Kafka topic with default values.
+
--
This example creates the `my-topic` Kafka topic.

.Creating a Kafka topic with default values
[source,shell]
----
$ rhoas kafka topic create my-topic
{
  "config": [
    {
      "key": "retention.ms",
      "value": "-1"
    }
  ],
  "name": "my-topic",
  "partitions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "leader": {
        "id": 1
      },
      "replicas": [
        {
          "id": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to use the default values,
you can specify the number of partitions (`--partitions`) and message retention time (`--retention-ms`).
For more information, see the `rhoas kafka topic create` help.
====
--

. If necessary, you can edit or delete the topic by using the `rhoas kafka topic update` and `rhoas kafka topic delete` commands.
